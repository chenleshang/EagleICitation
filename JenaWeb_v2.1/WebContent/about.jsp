                    <p style="font-size:120%;" align="justify">Much scientific publishing now involves data stored in a database, contributed by members of the scientific community, and extracted using queries. The goal of the research supported by NSF IIS 1302212 is to develop a framework for data citation which takes into account the large number of possible queries and therefore different citations; the need for citations to be both human and machine readable; and the need for citations to conform to various specifications and standards.</p> 
					<p style="font-size:120%;" align="justify">This project implements a simple framework for Eagle-i citations as specified <a href="https://www.eagle-i.net/get-involved/for-researchers/citing-an-eagle-i-resource/" class="color">here</a>.  RDF datasets have been downloaded from Eagle-i and are queried using SPARQL to generate citations.</p>
					<p style="font-size:120%;" align="justify">The work is currently in progress: only a subset of the institutions are currently included, and since Eagle-i does not export archives resources may change from the time that they were cited.</p>
